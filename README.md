##### This project shows how to configure a simple servlet to run on Tomcat in Kubernetes with distributed session replication and JCache implemented by Redis.

###### Tested configurations:
 - [src/main/resources/redisson-jcache.yaml](src/main/resources/redisson-jcache.yaml)
  
This is the servlet JCache implementation configuration file, it is configured to look for the redis server at hostname="redis"


 - [conf/context.xml](conf/context.xml)
 - [conf/redisson.yaml](conf/redisson.yaml)

This is the configuration for Tomcat session replication using the Redis server, it is configured to look for the redis server at hostname="redis"

#### Running make will list build targets

- DOCKER_REGISTRY 

Define environment variable $DOCKER_REGISTRY for the container registry used.

###### Local testing/Cluster testing tools
- [redis-ephemeral.sh](redis-ephemeral.sh)

This runs a local Redis server for development testing

- [cli.newsession](cli.newsession)
  
This calls the server at $TARGET (default localhost) to create a new session

- [cli](cli)

After a session is created, this call the server at $TARGET (default localhost) to continue to use the session created previously.


###### Sample output:
